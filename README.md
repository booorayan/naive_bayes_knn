## Description
The objectives of the project were:
  * Predict whether passengers will survive or not using knn classifier
  * Classify mails as either spam or not using naives bayes classifier 



## Experiment Design
This project employed the CRISP-DM methodology. The methodology entailed the following phases:
  * Problem Understanding
  * Data Understanding
  * Data Preparation/Cleaning
  * Modelling:

      Models used included naives bayes classifier, random forest, knn, xgboost classifier and logistic regression
  * Evaluation of Model:

      The metrics used for evaluating the performance of the models included classification report, confusion matrix, 
      cross val score and accuracy score
      
      Various classification models were compared with the knn classifier to determine the best models for predicting
      whether one survived or not.
      
## Libraries Used
The following python libraries were used for the project:
  * pandas 
  * numpy
  * scikit 
  * seaborn
  * matplotlib

The ML models used for the project include:
  * KNN classifier
  * Logistic regression
  * XGBoost Classifier
  * Random forest 
  * Naives Bayes Classifier
